# Pseudocode for Cybernetics + Public Art CPS  

Pseudocode is used to communicate an algorithm to anyone with basic programming knowledge.

According to Metwalli (2021), the core of pseudocode can be represented by six (6) programming constructs, namely:
*   SEQUENCE
    *   Input: READ, OBTAIN, GET
    *   Output: PRINT, DISPLAY, SHOW
    *   Compute: COMPUTE, CALCULATE, DETERMINE 
    *   Initialise: SET, INIT
    *   Add: INCREMENET, BUMP
    *   Sub: DECREMENT
*   WHILE 
*   REPEAT-UNTIL
*   FOR
*   IF-THEN-ELSE
*   CASE

Here is the pseudocode for our CPS:
