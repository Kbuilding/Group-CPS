### What CPS have we designed and developed?

We have created a web-based interface that, when synced with a wearable device equipped with a PPG sensor (Blood Volume Pulse), visualises the user’s heartbeat as the heartbeat of where they are situated in the world. The reason for using this visualisation is to illustrate/ demonstrate that we are all part of the world’s heartbeat/ create a sense of global community. 

The CPS, aptly named artBeat, works by using two key pieces of information (i) heartbeat data uploaded by users, which has typically been measured using a wearable device equipped with a PPG sensor and (ii) the country that the user associates their heartbeat with, recognising that where we are in the world isn’t necessarily where our heart lies. artBeat takes these two pieces of information across multiple users to calculate an 'average heartbeat' for every country around the world. This 'average heartbeat' is then represented by the speed of each country's animated trace — a faster trace means a faster average heartbeat. This means, that should the CPS go to scale, it could be possible to capture significant events (I.e., football fans watching the World Cup) and show the world at different stages of the day (I.e., as Europe begins to wake up Australia starts to slow down).  

As the Health and Wellbeing team, we wanted to lean into the idea that health is ‘a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being,’ having reflected on the past two years and the impact it has had, not only on physical health, but on mental health and social connection.  As practitioners of the New Branch of Engineering (NBE), we were interested in building a CPS where the technology functions as the intermediate between human-human interaction and incorporates technology that is ubiquitous to everyday life (i.e., wearable technology, web-interfaces). The purpose is to offer a reflection of how we connect; our interaction with technology and engagement with each other.  

> The visualisation shows one side of the world as 'busier' than the other to represent the different timezones. While one side of the world slows down, the other speeds up.

# Acknowledgements

Throughout this process we have received support from both staff and students.  At every stage, [Dr Mina Henein](https://github.com/MinaHenein?tab=repositories) has been there to offer help, answer questions, source resources and materials, and most of all, motivate us. We are grateful for his support, guidance and patience over the course of the CPS project. Dr Xuanying Zhu has also been a significant source of information, guidance and support, and she was instrumental in helping us with our AI component, providing code for both the filtering and the normalisation of the data.  

We also received support from both our tutors, Matthew and Memunat, who offered incredibly useful advice, particularly around project management, having both been through the same process as part of the 2019 and 2020 cohorts respectively.  

Professor Katherine Daniell and Dr Zena Assad both assisted us with conceptualising the CPS, both as an instrument of wonder and a CPS at scale. We are grateful for them both for indulging our foray into the theoretical.  

To our cohort, heartfelt thanks for being a part of the commiserations (video editing, am I right?) and our celebrations. Thank you for the feedback that you offered, both formally and informally.
