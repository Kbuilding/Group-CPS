### What CPS have we designed and developed?

This project is a web application that uses the human heartbeat to illuminate an outline of the world as an artpiece. Users can upload their heartbeat data from a wearable (at this stage, an Empatica 4) which personalises their visual experiences. The project is a web-based application, the project can be implemented by anyone who has access to a device and a wearable. In today’s noisy, complex, and often distracted world, we wanted to offer people a mindful moment – to explore something new, inspire a sense of awe, wonder and presence, as well as a sense of connection with others.  

> The visualisation shows one side of the world as 'busier' than the other to represent the different timezones. While one side of the world slows down, the other speeds up.

### What motivated us to design and develop this CPS?

### What tools did we use?

- GitHub
- P5.js
- VSCode
- Python
- Filter 

### What challenges did we face — and overcome — throughout the design and development process? 

Challenge 1: Discovered in Fortnight 4 of Semester 2 that there was an existing art installation that closely resembled our initial idea.

Challenge 2: Building in lockdown presented challenges to design and build this prototype, and meant we conducted a pivot in design from a physical display to a web application to make the project more accessible to users.  

### What new skills have we gained? 

- Data collection
- Data pre-processing 
- Collaborative coding 
- GitHub
- P5.js
- Storyboarding 

### What new ideas/ thoughts/ reflections offer insights for the NBE?

### What could we have done differently? (i.e., how can you learn from our mistakes?)

Do Differently (related to challenge 1): Take the time in the early stages to undertake a thorough review of the existing scholarship. 

### What next?
